# 🧠 Task 4: Classification with Logistic Regression

This repository contains the implementation of a binary classification model using **Logistic Regression** as part of the AI & ML Internship program.

---

## 📌 Objective

To build a logistic regression classifier to predict binary outcomes using the **Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset**, and evaluate the model using standard performance metrics.

## 📁 Files

- `task_4_logistic_regression.ipynb` – Jupyter Notebook with full implementation.
- `breast_cancer_data.csv` – Dataset (only needed if using external CSV instead of sklearn).
- `README.md` – This file.

## 📚 Dataset

- **Name**: Breast Cancer Wisconsin Diagnostic Dataset
- **Source**: [Kaggle Link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data)
- **Target**: `0` = Malignant, `1` = Benign

---

## ⚙️ Tools & Libraries

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn

## 🔬 Workflow

1. **Load Dataset**
2. **Preprocess Data** (Train/Test Split, Standardization)
3. **Train Logistic Regression Model**
4. **Evaluate using**:
   - Confusion Matrix
   - Precision
   - Recall
   - ROC-AUC Score
   - ROC Curve
5. **Visualize Sigmoid Function**
6. **Answer Interview Questions**

## 📊 Evaluation Metrics

| Metric             | Description                                  |
|--------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Confusion Matrix   | Shows TP, TN, FP, FN                         |
| Precision          | How many predicted positives are actually positive |
| Recall             | How many actual positives were correctly predicted |
| ROC-AUC Score      | Measures classification performance across thresholds |
